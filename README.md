Welcome!

![Portrait of Hieu Minh Truong][1]

My name is Hieu Minh Truong. I am a Ph.D. student in [Microbiology][2] at the University of Wisconsin - Madison.  
Toward a sustainable world, I focus my doctoral research on using (friendly) *Clostridium* bacteria to convert waste materials into valuable industrial chemicals.  
I am happy to be part of the [Ujor Laboratory][3], Department of Food Science. Together, we hope to create an impact on the world.

This Git repository houses code scripts related to my doctoral research, including those used for miscellaneous tasks as well as data analyses.
