Welcome!

![Portrait of Hieu Minh Truong][1]

My name is Hieu Minh Truong, and I am from Viet Nam. I am a Ph.D. student in [Microbiology][2] at the University of Wisconsin - Madison.  
To help build a flourishing world for everyone, I focus my doctoral research on using (friendly) *Clostridium* bacteria to convert waste materials into valuable industrial chemicals.  

This Git repository houses code scripts related to my doctoral research, which are used for data cleaning and analyses as well as miscellaneous tasks.

I am happy to be part of the [Ujor Laboratory][3], Department of Food Science. Together, we hope to create a positive impact on the world.
